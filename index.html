  जिंदगी फुर्सत है 

  लेकिन,
  जीने वालों को फुर्सत कहाँ?
  101 नुसके मनोरंजन के
  नुस्को मे फुर्सत कहाँ?

  दो धडकनो के बीच की फुर्सत, जानने को दिल बेताब रहा.
  आदतोंसे मजबूर, इस दिल और दिमाग को
  एक लम्हे की फुर्सत कहाँ?

  बडी मुद्दत के बाद जब हम तुम मिलें,
  हमारे दिलों ने एक ही तमन्ना की,
  के ईस तरह मिलते रहने की "फुर्सत" सब को मिलें.
  </pre>

  <h2> What is Fursat?</h2>
  <p>
    The lack of physical space in today's world seems to be a big issue,
    especially in the overpopulated cities which we have accepted as a norm.
    What is daunting and omnipresent is the lack of mental/psychological space.
    Our overthinking and burden of our own self leave very little space for
    something new to take place in our brains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Architecture and design deal with both these issues. In our day-to-day
    living, the absence of both physical and psychological space should
    naturally lead us to find Fursat. When one experiences any of the
    architecturally meaningful buildings, one cannot miss the attention to
    detail that is an inherent part of its conceptualization and construction.
    Human existence on this planet is old enough to find such architecture very
    close to wherever one may live on this planet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having said that, as an architect practicing in the most affluent era of
    human existence, one is often disheartened to find no connection with the
    masterpieces that were achieved in the past. There are many obvious reasons
    that one can cite for this overall degradation of what we, as humans, are
    creating, calling it 'our physical environment' in which we live our daily
    lives. One of the prime reasons for this degradation seems to me the lack of
    attention and awareness.
  </p>
  <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    How to bring back that attention and awareness is a challenge that Fursat
    Space, as an entity, would like to face. Fursat shall be 'a sangha', 'a
    family' of dedicated people who would come together in order to learn
    eternally and bring back the attention and awareness, nurturing it through
    the act of selflessly constructing architecture. The skills and technical
    knowledge will be shared and practiced through routine training modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    The training will primarily focus on collaboration and cooperation
    techniques with an emphasis on selflessness and hence the presence of love
    and empathy. A set of skilled people that is aware of the potential of
    collaboration, at the base of which is understanding oneself, will sustain
    and thrive on the limitless energy of the Space Fursat. Those who would like
    to experiment with Fursat may not be skilled as a prerequisite, but they
    will have to get trained in one or many skill sets of the construction work.
    They will be paid a reasonable stipend during the training period.
  </p>
  <p>
    The training modules may be run on live construction sites or in a dedicated
    training center. Whenever there is no work on-site, the team shall
    concentrate on training and upscaling of skills and systems of collaborative
    effort. During these times also, the members of Fursat will be paid the
    minimum wages, which can be recovered from past/future commissions.
  </p>
  <h2>Core Values</h2>
  <p>
    There will be a constant/consistent effort to excel, with an emphasis on
    collaboration that will lead to an 'Open to all', 'Truthful', and
    'Transparent' coexistence that will be independent of any kind of authority.
    Although the functional hierarchical structure will be a necessity for the
    organized effort in order to achieve what is planned, this hierarchy will
    have no relevance whatsoever in the relationships within the Sangha apart
    from the organized effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fursat will bring back the love, calmness, and peace that are the origin of
    everything that is beautiful.
  </p>
